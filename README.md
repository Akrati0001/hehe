Neutralization Key Concepts\n- **Definition**: Neutralization is a chemical reaction between an acid and a base that results in the formation of water and a salt.\n- **pH Scale**: The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where 0-6 indicates acidity, 7 is neutral, and 8-14 indicates basicity (alkalinity).\n- **Indicators**: Substances like litmus paper or phenolphthalein can indicate the pH of a solution.\n  \n### Essential Concepts to Understand\n- The role of acids and bases.\n- The chemical equation for neutralization: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Acid} + \\text{Base} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\text{Water}\n  \\]\n- The importance of neutralization in everyday life (e.g., antacids).\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n1. **Identify Acids and Bases**: \n   - Acids donate hydrogen ions (H⁺) in solution (e.g., HCl, vinegar).\n   - Bases accept hydrogen ions (e.g., NaOH, baking soda).\n  \n2. **Reaction Process**:\n   - When mixed, the H⁺ from the acid reacts with the OH⁻ from the base to form water (H₂O).\n   - The remaining ions form a salt.\n\n3. **Resulting Solution**
